1. Strengths:
    - consider a topic as strength if the student is displaying strong confidence in, and hence can score very high marks.
    - consider a study behaviour as strength if it is enabling the student to achieve good performance.
    - consider a cognitive feature as strength if it is helping them in their learning, practising and improving abilities.
2. Challenges:
    - consider a topic as challenges if the student is displaying weak to average confidence in a topic, and is unable to score good marks.
    - based on the benchmark data provided, compare and see if a topic the student is weak in has high weightage.
    - consider a study behaviour as challenges if it's limiting them from performing better.
    - consider a cognitive feature as challenges if it's limiting them from performing better.

3. Opportunities:
    - what topics he/she is displaying medium confidence in, and and can be improved to score good marks.
    - if the student is average to good in a certain topic and if that topic has medium to high weightage (based on benchmark data), then consider it as a potential opportunity that can be achieved.
    - what study behaviour he/she can improve or acquire that can help her pursue her opportunities.
    - what cognitive thinking/mindset the student can acquire to help her mentally towards her opportunities.

4. Actionables:
    - suggest what topics or subjects needs to be improved, along with the best study behaviour and cognitive changes the student should inculcate.
    - identify easy topics and suggest how the student can learn quickly to improve his score.
    - suggest the best strategy to tackle important topics the student is weak at, based on the student's study and cognitive profile.

Analyse the student's strengths and challenges based on their JEE preparation confidence scores, study profile, and cognitive questionnaire responses.

                Follow this exact structure in your response:

                **Strengths**
                Identify 5 key strengths. For each strength:
                    - Start with a subject area (e.g., "Physics:", "Chemistry:", "Mathematics:", "Study Behaviour:", "Cognitive Feature:")
                    - Use second-person perspective ("You")
                    - Include specific numerical scores where applicable
                    - Highlight specific topics or skills

                **Challenges**
                Identify 5 key challenges. For each challenge:
                    - Follow the same structure as Strengths
                    - Identify specific areas of improvement
                    - Mention numerical scores for areas of concern
                                 
                Maintain a friendly and progressive tone throughout. Address the student directly using "you" and "your".


Suggest opportunities and actionables based on their JEE preparation strengths and challenges.
                Follow this exact structure in your response:
                                 
                **Opportunities**:
                List 5 opportunities for improvement. For each:
                    - Identify an area where the student can improve
                    - Suggest a specific, brief strategy for improvement
                    - Relate to the strengths and challenges mentioned

                **Actionables**:
                Provide 5 specific, actionable steps. For each:
                    - Offer a concrete, implementable suggestion
                    - Keep it brief and focused (1-2 sentences max)
                    - Relate to the identified strengths, challenges, and opportunities
                    - Maintain an encouraging tone
